# Mars Exploration Route Planning and Charging Station Optimization

**Technologies Used**: Python, simpleai, Matplotlib

## Description
This project focuses on developing solutions for navigation and charging station placement on Mars. It involves implementing and comparing various search algorithms (A*, Greedy, Uniform Cost, BFS) to find optimal navigation paths on realistic Martian terrain maps. Additionally, a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)-based solution was designed for optimizing the placement of charging stations, ensuring adherence to distance constraints and maximizing station visibility.

## Features
- **Path Planning**: Implemented and compared multiple search algorithms (A*, Greedy, Uniform Cost, BFS) to compute the most efficient navigation paths on Martian terrain.
- **Charging Station Optimization**: Developed a CSP-based solution to place charging stations, considering constraints such as minimum/maximum distances between stations.
- **Greedy & Simulated Annealing**: Applied these algorithms to maximize station visibility while ensuring coverage and feasibility on the Martian surface.

## Results
The implemented algorithms successfully determined the best paths for navigating Mars' surface and optimized charging station placement while adhering to constraints, ensuring the feasibility of both navigation and energy supply on Mars missions.
